# üçè Calorie Counter & üé≤ Dice Roller

This project combines two simple yet fun Python programs: a **Calorie Counter** for popular fruits and a **Dice Roller** for various-sided dice. 

- The **Calorie Counter** allows you to input a fruit name and receive its caloric value.
- The **Dice Roller** gives you the option to roll different dice, such as a 4-sided, 6-sided, or even a 100-sided die!

## üåü Features

1. **Calorie Counter**:
   - Input the name of a fruit (e.g., "Apple", "Banana", etc.) and get its caloric information.
   - The program supports a variety of fruits and is case-insensitive. It will let you know if the fruit is not in the database.

2. **Dice Roller**:
   - Choose to roll a dice with a custom number of sides (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, or 100).
   - Get a random dice roll result and roll again if desired.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Run the script and choose to use either the calorie counter or dice roller.
2. **Calorie Counter**:
   - Enter the name of a fruit when prompted.
   - The program will display the number of calories in the fruit if it's available in the database.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   Item: Apple
   Calories: 130
Dice Roller:

When prompted, select whether to roll a dice.
If "Y" is chosen, select the type of dice you want to roll (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, or 100 sides).
The program will display a random result based on the chosen dice.
Example:

bash
Do you want to roll a dice? [Y/N] Y
What dice do you want to roll? [4/6/8/10/12/20/100] 20
